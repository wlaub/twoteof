TODO:

* trigger/entity to activate extra sounds mode
    * sets save data enable, adds hooks
    * similar to self destruct but simpler
    * map sounds to various actions
    * mouth pop on doublejump super
    * click on doublejump

* invisible tileset for ending
* g-15 do something about the styleground

* glue spinner shatter sprites

* final cave booster room cutscene
* jitter spinners in final rooms
* monolith badeline conversation
* lighter final cave backgrounds?
* tas route
* self destruct sequence
* fancy stylegrounds
* make sure that ultra ending sets permanent flag to change the note
* map sw caves
* what if the 100% ending just snakes all the way up to the original intro car room? that is like the last 4 rooms plus the whole escape sequence up and to the right. It would be a long and tedious climb. Maybe use a lot of dream blocks. Just like climb dream blocks in the void. Maybe like dream blocks and a strong up wind in the void. Maybe some feathers? Maybe variable speed dream blocks, lots of them fast but some slow.

* final room wallbounce hint decal
* dash block setup hint decal

* maybe a simple bulging square decal to put behind floating water blocks
* maybe a litte jellyfish resting platform decal or a line they hang down on

* watchtower decals 
* hydrant decal
* cherry tree decal
* lightbar background decal

* cave explorer decal


    if entity.ignoreConnection then
    	return sprites, borders
    end

* music
* sounds effects
* sound placement
* all lore
* all room hints


* make custom lock block entity
    * background mirror sprite
    * may need to add a custom MirrorSurface to get the reflection
    * maybe it can detect and hide decals beneath it until it goes away and then make them visible again?
    * audio timings:
        1.216s/1.242s : first click - key turn start
        1.723s : second click - door animation start
        2.342s : third click - door burst start
        2.633s : poof        

        1.2s + 0.5 frames: animation start
        Maybe add initial cracks to key sprite instead since the first click seems to align with the key "enter" animation starting
