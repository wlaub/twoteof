    * mouth pop on doublejump super
    * click on doublejump




    if entity.ignoreConnection then
    	return sprites, borders
    end

* music
* sounds effects
* sound placement
* all lore
* all room hints


* make custom lock block entity
    * background mirror sprite
    * may need to add a custom MirrorSurface to get the reflection
    * maybe it can detect and hide decals beneath it until it goes away and then make them visible again?
    * audio timings:
        1.216s/1.242s : first click - key turn start
        1.723s : second click - door animation start
        2.342s : third click - door burst start
        2.633s : poof        

        1.2s + 0.5 frames: animation start
        Maybe add initial cracks to key sprite instead since the first click seems to align with the key "enter" animation starting
